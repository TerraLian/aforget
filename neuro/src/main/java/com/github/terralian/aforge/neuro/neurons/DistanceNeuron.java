     * The output value is also stored in {@link Neuron#output}
     * property.

     * The method may be called safely from multiple threads to compute neuron's
     * output value for the specified input values. However, the value of
     * {@link Neuron#output} property in multi-threaded environment is not predictable,
     * since it may hold neuron's output computed from any of the caller threads. Multi-threaded
     * access to the method is useful in those cases when it is required to improve performance
     * by utilizing several threads and the computation is based on the immediate return value
     * of the method, but not on neuron's output property.
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException Wrong length of the input vector, which is not
     * equal to the {@link Neuron#inputsCount} expected value
