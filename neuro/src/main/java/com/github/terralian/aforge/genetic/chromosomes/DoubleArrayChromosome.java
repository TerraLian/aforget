     * Before crossover is done a random number is generated in [0, 1] range - if the
     * random number is smaller than {@link #crossoverBalancer}, then the first crossover
     * type is used, otherwise second type is used.
     * 
     * <p>The <b>first crossover type</b> is based on interchanging
     * range of genes (array elements) between these chromosomes and is known
     * as one point crossover. A crossover point is selected randomly and chromosomes
     * interchange genes, which start from the selected point.
     * 
     * <p>The <b>second crossover type</b> is aimed to produce one child, which genes'
     * values are between corresponding genes of parents, and another child, which genes'
     * values are outside of the range formed by corresponding genes of parents. 
     * Let take, for example, two genes with 1.0 and 3.0 valueÃ» (of course chromosomes have
     * more genes, but for simplicity lets think about one). First of all we randomly choose
     * a factor in the [0, 1] range, let's take 0.4. Then, for each pair of genes (we have
     * one pair) we calculate difference value, which is 2.0 in our case. In the result weï¿½ll
     * have two children ï¿½ one between and one outside of the range formed by parents genes' values.
     * We may have 1.8 and 3.8 children, or we may have 0.2 and 2.2 children. As we can see
     * we add/subtract (chosen randomly) <i>difference * factor</i>. So, this gives us exploration
     * in between and in near outside. The randomly chosen factor is applied to all genes
     * of the chromosomes participating in crossover.
